                Because {{ capability.organization }} is
                organized democratically, the use of this capability is
                based on the democratic agreement of the members of
                {{ capability.organization }}. Thus, using this capability
                won't take effect immediately. Instead, a proposal will be
                created that will have to be voted by the members of
                {{ capability.organization }}. Only when the majority votes for
                your proposal, it will take effect.
